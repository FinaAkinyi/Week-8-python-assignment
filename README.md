 Insights and Reflections
Qatar achieved the highest vaccination rate among the analyzed countries.

Palestine reported the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, with a notable spike in 2022.

Afghanistan and Lesotho had lower reported case numbers, potentially due to limited testing and underreporting.

Kenya had a low vaccine uptake, with only 24% of the population vaccinated
